Naturally, Euler attempted to generalize the problem for arbitrary integers n \u0026gt; 0; while not producing any proofs, the ideas that Euler touched on would be expanded by Legendre, Gauss, and Lagrange. The goal for this talk is to outline a strategy that answers Fermat\u0026rsquo;s original problem along with a few more cases. If time permits, we\u0026rsquo;ll just mention a result that solves the general problem for countably many n integers.\nLink to Zoom meeting: https://zoom.us/j/98801740991\nVideo: Google Drive\n","date":1596465854,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596465854,"objectID":"1d2a5f0c8b08d9ec559a736445852307","permalink":"/talk/primes-of-the-form/","publishdate":"2020-08-03T10:44:14-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/primes-of-the-form/","section":"talk","summary":"Speaker: Louis Arenas, scheduled at Thursday, August 6th 2:00pm @ [zoom](https://zoom.us/j/98801740991).","tags":[],"title":"Primes of the Form $p = x^2 + ny^2$","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"   Title: Introduction to matroids\nSpeaker: Lina Fajardo Gomez\nDate: Thursday, July 30th\nTime: 2:00pm\nAbstract: Matroids are mathematical objects that abstract the notion of linearly independent sets.

However, one wonders exactly how these algebras arise in such contexts, and moreover what is even meant by “infinite-dimensional Lie algebra” in the first place. In this talk, I will try to give a friendly introduction to the field of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras, and try to give the listener some operational familiarity with these structures by providing a few explicit examples. Furthermore, I will mention a few specific problems in mathematics where such algebras have been useful.\nLink to Zoom meeting: https://zoom.us/j/5082038044?pwd=YUVBdkZvZU5RYXBYZmU5ZGRFZnE1Zz09\nVideo: Google Drive\nSlides: Google Drive\n","date":1593986136,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593986136,"objectID":"2aa7a5403b9c16df3bd0b58d8afdd16b","permalink":"/talk/usf/infinite-lie-algebra/","publishdate":"2020-07-05T17:55:36-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/usf/infinite-lie-algebra/","section":"talk","summary":"**Speaker:** Nathan Hayford, scheduled at 2:00 pm, July 9th @ [zoom](https://zoom.us/j/5082038044?pwd=YUVBdkZvZU5RYXBYZmU5ZGRFZnE1Zz09)","tags":["Lie algebra"],"title":"A Gentle Introduction to Infinite-Dimensional Lie Algebras","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"   Title: The Nevanlinna-Pick Interpolation Problem\nSpeaker: John Kyei\nDate: Thursday, July 2nd\nTime: 2:00pm\nAbstract: In this presentation, I will give an introductory discussion on the general Nevanlina-Pick Interpolation problem .

In his 1903\u0026rsquo;s paper, Fredholm introduced a determinant of a functional, which now is called Fredholm determinant. In this lecture, we will begin with the definition of determinant in the finite-dimensional spaces and review some properties of the determinants. After that, we will focus on the determinant of form $det(I+F)$ where $F$ is \u0026ldquo;small\u0026rdquo;. Following Fredholm\u0026rsquo;s 1903 paper, we will discuss Fredholm determinant $D_f$ and explore some properties of the determinant and how it connects to the finite determinants. Lastly, we will discuss how to construct the famous \u0026ldquo;soliton\u0026rdquo; solution to the equation of Koreteweg-de Vries by the so-called Fredholm determinant method introduced by Pöppe(1983).\nVideo: google drive\n","date":1591635672,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591635672,"objectID":"260d2a99e4a1fb972b61f91c62412f4c","permalink":"/talk/fredholm-determinants/","publishdate":"2020-06-08T13:01:12-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/fredholm-determinants/","section":"talk","summary":"**Speaker**: Fudong Wang,\nscheduled at 2:00 pm, Thursday, June 11, 2020 @ [zoom](https://zoom.us/j/99122102308?pwd=YTN1bVJHUm1MNFhGV3NZVVZDQkR4QT09) ","tags":["Fredholm determinant","Soliton","KdV","Integrable system"],"title":"An Elementary Introdcution to Fredholm Determinants","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Topology"],"content":"Speaker: Emanuele Zappala\nTime: 2:00pm, Thursday, June 4\nAbstract: In this talk I will give a brief introduction to knot theory and the notion of knot invariant.
