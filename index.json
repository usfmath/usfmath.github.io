From Riemann’s point of view, the question was to address the discrepancy between the 3g-3-dimensional space of moduli for compact Riemann surfaces of genus g from the g(g+1)/2-dimensional space of Siegel matrices, in which the space of Riemann surfaces embeds, via the period matrix. The problem remained open for almost a millennium. The first hint of a solution to this problem was found (somewhat surprisingly) by I. Krichever (1977), when he showed (more or less) that the period matrix for a Riemann surface could be used to construct tau functions for the KP hierarchy. S. Novikov conjectured that the converse also held, thus answering the Riemann-Schottky problem a la methods of integrable systems. This turned out to indeed be the case, with a proof from T. Shiota (1986) shortly thereafter. In this talk, I will attempt to fill in some of the details of this story, and explain some of the consequences of this theorem, both in integrable systems and algebraic geometry.\nLink to the Zoom meeting: https://zoom.us/j/96802432385\nPart II link: https://zoom.us/s/97923273524\n","date":1613415043,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1613415043,"objectID":"9aed11cfd5e8dbc541aef9717c8a1323","permalink":"/talk/riemann-schottky-problem/","publishdate":"2021-02-15T13:50:43-05:00","relpermalink":"/talk/riemann-schottky-problem/","section":"talk","summary":"Speaker: Nathan Hayford @[zoom]( https://zoom.us/j/96802432385) .

Lorentz in 1910 gave a series of lectures titled \u0026ldquo;Old and new problems in physics\u0026rdquo;. In the last lecture he mentions that J. Jean is interested in studying the growth rate of overtones of an electromagnetic wave in a bounded domain. He conjectures that the growth rate is independent of the shape of the domain and depends only on the volume and dimension of the domain. Herman Weyl, who was in attendance, precisely describes how fast these overtones grow two years after this lecture series. Since Weyl\u0026rsquo;s law holds for vibrating membranes, we start by describing the overtones of a drumhead via Dirichlet eigenvalues, compute the eigenvalues explicitly for a string with fixed ends, and build towards a proof of Weyl\u0026rsquo;s law in 2D for simply connected domains.\nLink to the Zoom Meeting: https://zoom.us/j/92117761401\n","date":1612380274,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612380274,"objectID":"6cecff7ce7dc993d4e0fe09dac745bfe","permalink":"/talk/weyl-law-hear-area-drum/","publishdate":"2021-02-03T14:24:34-05:00","relpermalink":"/talk/weyl-law-hear-area-drum/","section":"talk","summary":"**Speaker**: Louis Arenas, @[zoom](https://zoom.us/j/92117761401)","tags":[],"title":"Weyl's law and  hearing yhe  area of a drum","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"   Title: Prodsimplicial and p-path complexes on directed graphs\nSpeaker: Lina Fajardo Gomez\nDate/Time: Wednesday, January 20th, 2020\nAbstract: At face value, a graph is a simplicial complex that only has faces of dimension 0 (vertices) and 1 (edges).

In his 1903\u0026rsquo;s paper, Fredholm introduced a determinant of a functional, which now is called Fredholm determinant. In this lecture, we will begin with the definition of determinant in the finite-dimensional spaces and review some properties of the determinants. After that, we will focus on the determinant of form $det(I+F)$ where $F$ is \u0026ldquo;small\u0026rdquo;. Following Fredholm\u0026rsquo;s 1903 paper, we will discuss Fredholm determinant $D_f$ and explore some properties of the determinant and how it connects to the finite determinants. Lastly, we will discuss how to construct the famous \u0026ldquo;soliton\u0026rdquo; solution to the equation of Koreteweg-de Vries by the so-called Fredholm determinant method introduced by Pöppe(1983).\nVideo: google drive\n","date":1591635672,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591635672,"objectID":"260d2a99e4a1fb972b61f91c62412f4c","permalink":"/talk/fredholm-determinants/","publishdate":"2020-06-08T13:01:12-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/fredholm-determinants/","section":"talk","summary":"**Speaker**: Fudong Wang,\nscheduled at 2:00 pm, Thursday, June 11, 2020 @ [zoom](https://zoom.us/j/99122102308?pwd=YTN1bVJHUm1MNFhGV3NZVVZDQkR4QT09) ","tags":["Fredholm determinant","Soliton","KdV","Integrable system"],"title":"An Elementary Introdcution to Fredholm Determinants","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Topology"],"content":"Speaker: Emanuele Zappala\nTime: 2:00pm, Thursday, June 4\nAbstract: In this talk I will give a brief introduction to knot theory and the notion of knot invariant. Next I will describe the process of algebraization of knot theory which naturally gives Yang-Baxter operators, Yetter-Drinfeld modules and racks/quandles etc. After recalling the definition of cohomology of racks, I will proceed to show how to construct an invariant of links and knotted surfaces from cocycles. I will therefore explain some recent joint works with M. Elhamdadi and M. Saito relating self-distributivity of higher arity structures and invariants of framed links, with a (categorical) perspective on how to realize them as quantum invariants.\nZoom links: click me.\nSlides: google drive\n","date":1591228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591402787,"objectID":"a840c34062b4ac8f79b5e3aa8c791c28","permalink":"/talk/usf/quantum-invariants/","publishdate":"2020-06-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/usf/quantum-invariants/","section":"talk","summary":"**Speaker**: Emanuele Zappala, scheduled at 2:00pm, Thursday, June 4, 2020 @ [zoom](https://zoom.us/j/99982471312?pwd=Z0NTR2UraHZTQXI5TkdzNlM5K0FPUT09)","tags":["cohomology","Quantum invariants"],"title":"Quantum invariants of framed links from cohomology of self-distributive structures","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Title: Darboux transformation and soliton equations.\nSpeaker: Yehui Huang (North China Electric Power University).\nDate: Thursday, February $20^{th}$\nTime: 11:00am\nPlace: CIS 1045\nAbstract: In this talk, I will introduce a transformation originated by Darboux in his study of the linear Sturm-Liouville problem.

Such problems include the isoperimetric problem, minimal surface problem, and the formulation of Lagrangian mechanics.

We will also discuss how such techniques may be applied to write Lagrangian formulations of theories like electromagnetism and general relativity, if time permits.\n","date":1580605378,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591405378,"objectID":"2180499ce9146422c2b6a0bb326deed3","permalink":"/talk/usf/variation-problem-and-how-to-solve-it/","publishdate":"2020-02-01T21:02:58-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/usf/variation-problem-and-how-to-solve-it/","section":"talk","summary":"**Speaker:** Nathan Hayford.","tags":["variational problem","mathematical physics"],"title":"Variation Problem and How to Solve It","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Title: Introduction to the Lorentz Group.\nSpeaker: Louis Arenas.\nDate: Thursday, January $30^{th}$\nTime: 11:00am\nPlace: CIS 1023\nAbstract: The goal of this talk is to introduce the audience to the definition of the Lorentz group and motivation in general relativity.
