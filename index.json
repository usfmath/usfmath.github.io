Thus, the question of recognizing a certain non-autonomous recurrence as a discrete Painlevé equation and understanding its position in Sakai’s classification scheme, recognizing whether it is equivalent to some known (model) example, and especially finding an explicit change of coordinates transforming it to such example, becomes one of the central ones. Fortunately, Sakai’s geometric theory provides an almost algorithmic procedure of answering this question. In this work we illustrate this procedure by considering two examples. The first example comes from the theory of discrete orthogonal polynomials. There are many connections between orthogonal polynomials and Painlevé equations, both differential and discrete. In particular, often the coefficients of three-term recurrence relations for orthogonal polynomials can be expressed in terms of solutions of some discrete Painlevé equation. In this example we study orthogonal polynomials with general hypergeometric weight and show that their recurrence coefficients satisfy, after some change of variables, the standard discrete Painlevé-V equation. We also provide an explicit change of variables transforming this equation to the standard form. This is joint work with Galina Filipuk (University of Warsaw, Poland) and Alexander Stokes (University College, London, UK). The second example is also related to the theory of orthogonal polynomials but the motivation comes from the Probability Theory. We consider the problem of tiling a hexagon by lozenges with some generalized weight and are interested in computing important statistical properties of this model called the gap probabilities. This model can be related to a q-Racah discrete orthogonal polynomial ensemble, and this computation is again done with the help of discrete Painlevé equation. This is a joint work with Alisa Knizel (Columbia University).\n","date":1666617112,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666617112,"objectID":"a4a9d10f10481603438a7b52f7ca3e99","permalink":"/talk/discretepainleve/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T09:11:52-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/discretepainleve/","section":"talk","summary":"**Speaker**: Professor Anton Dzhamay (University of Northern Colorado), Friday, November 4th at 12:00pm, NES 102","tags":[],"title":"Discrete Painlevé Equations and Orthogonal Polynomials","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Title: Around a Theorem of Pólya\nSpeaker: Louis Arenas\nDate/Time/Location: Friday, October 21st and 28th at 12:00pm, NES 102\nAbstract: Random walks have cemented themselves as relevant objects of study in modeling diverse phenomenon ranging from Brownian motion to the prediction of European stock options through Black-Scholes.

Genome rearrangement in some ciliate species can be modeled by subword pattern deletions in double-occurrence words (DOWs), words where each symbol appears exactly twice. The iterated deletions can be represented by a graph whose vertices are DOWs connected by an edge if one word can be obtained from the other through a pattern deletion. On this graph, called the ``word graph'', we build a complex comprised of cells defined by Cartesian products of simplicial digraphs where we define a boundary operator and compute homology groups.

Although applicable to any type of solute and fluid flow, we restrict the examples of our theory to the tracer advected by flows which are induced by a periodically oscillating wall in a Newtonian fluid between two infinite parallel plates as well as flow in an infinitely long duct. These wall motions produce the well-known Stokes layer shear solutions which are exact solutions of the Navier–Stokes equations. With these, we first calculate the second Aris moment for all time and its long-time limiting effective diffusivity as a function of the geometrical parameters, frequency, viscosity, and diffusivity. Using a new formalism based upon the Helmholtz operator, we establish a new single series formula for the variance valid for all time. We show that the viscous dominated limit results in a linear shear layer for which the effective diffusivity is bounded with upper bound $\\kappa (1+A^2/(2L^2))$, where $\\kappa $ is the tracer diffusivity, A is the amplitude of oscillation, and L is the gap thickness. Alternatively, for finite viscosities, we show that the enhanced diffusion is unbounded, diverging in the high-frequency limit. Non-dimensionalization and physical arguments are given to explain these striking differences. Asymptotics for the high-frequency behavior as well as the low viscosity limit are computed. We present a study of the effective diffusivity surface as a function of the non-dimensional parameters which shows how a maximum can exists for various parameter sweeps. Physical experiments are performed in water using particle tracking velocimetry to quantitatively measure the fluid flow. Using fluorescein dye as the passive tracer, we document that the theory is quantitatively accurate. Specifically, image analysis suggests that the distribution variance be measured using the full width at half maximum statistic which is robust to noise. Further, we show that the scalar skewness is zero for linear shear flows at all times, whereas for the nonlinear Stokes layer, exact analysis shows that the skewness sign can be controlled through the phase of the oscillating wall. Further, for single-frequency wall modes, we establish that the long-time skewness decays at the faster rate of $t^{-3/2}$ as compared with steady shear scalar skewness which decays at rate $t^{-1/2}$.

For sake of clarity, we will first deal with 1-matrix models, and illustrate how they count the number of planar diagrams in a certain limit. Then, we discuss the 2-matrix models, which enumerate 2-colored planar diagrams. For this, we will need the Harish-Chandra (Itzykson-Zuber) formula, which we also derive. Before discussing the connections of these matrix models to enumeration problems, we first derive some basic facts about the space of Hermitian matrices that we will eventually need in order to perform calculations.\nWe will always let $\\mathcal{H}$n denote the space of $n\\times n$ Hermitian matrices, i.e. matrices $X$ such that $X^\\dagger = X$ (\u0026quot;$\\dagger$\u0026quot; here denotes hermitian conjugate). The dimension of this space may be computed by noticing the following: the hermiticity condition requires that the diagonal of the matrix be real ($z = \\bar{z}$ implies that $z$ is real), therefore the diagonal entries contribute $n$ variables. Above the diagonal, there are $2 \\cdot \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} = n (n-1)$ variables (the factor of two coming from real + imaginary components); therefore we find the dimension of the space of Hermitian matrices to be \\begin{align} \\dim H_n = n + 2 \\cdot \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} = n^2. \\end{align} It is often convenient for us to work in the so-called eigenvalue variables on the space of Hermitian matrices. These eigenvalues are of course real, by properties of Hermitian matrices; the remaining variables are variables in the unitary group $U(n)/U_{diag}(n)$ and are called angular variables. This is apparent, by writing $X = U^\\dagger \\Lambda U$; note that replacing $U \\to \\text{diag}(e^{i\\theta_1},\\cdots e^{i\\theta_n} )U$ does not change the representation. Defining $du := dU^\\dagger U = -du^{\\dagger}$, we find that $dX$ takes the form \\begin{align*} dX = d(U^\\dagger \\Lambda U) \u0026amp;= dU^\\dagger \\Lambda U+ U^\\dagger d\\Lambda U + U^\\dagger \\Lambda dU \\\\\\ \u0026amp;= U^\\dagger (d u^\\dagger \\Lambda + d \\Lambda + \\Lambda d u) U \\\\\\ \u0026amp;= U^\\dagger (d \\Lambda + [\\Lambda, d u] ) U. \\end{align*}\nThe metric can then be computed as \\begin{align*} g = \\text{tr} (dX^\\dagger dX) = \\text{tr}(d \\Lambda d \\Lambda) + \\text{tr}([\\Lambda, d u])^2, \\end{align*} which is diagonal in the coordinates $(d\\lambda_i, du_{ij})$: \\begin{align*} g = \\sum_{i = 1}^n d\\lambda_i^2 + 2 \\sum_{i \u0026lt; j} (\\lambda_i - \\lambda_j)^2 (du_{ij})^2 \\end{align*} The volume form is then \\begin{align*} d\\text{vol}(X) \u0026amp;= \\sqrt{\\det g} \\prod_{i=1}^n d\\lambda_i \\prod_{i \u0026lt; j} du_{ij} \\\\\\ \u0026amp;= 2^{n(n-1)} \\prod(\\lambda_i - \\lambda_j)^2 \\prod_{i=1}^n d\\lambda_i \\prod_{i \u0026lt; j} du_{ij} \\\\\\ \u0026amp;\\propto dU \\prod_{i \u0026lt; j}(\\lambda_i - \\lambda_j)^2 \\prod_{i=1}^n d\\lambda_i, \\end{align*} where $dU$ is the Haar measure on $U(n)/U_{diag}(n)$. The quantity \\begin{equation} V(\\lambda) := \\prod_{i \u0026lt; j}(\\lambda_i - \\lambda_j) = \\det(\\lambda_i^{j-1}) \\end{equation} is called the Vandermonde determinant. We shall meet it often later. The exponent of two in the Vandermonde determinant comes from the fact that there are twice as many variables $du_{ij}$, with contributions coming from real and imaginary parts, respectively. Because it is a quantity we will need later, we also compute the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the submanifold of the eigenvalue coordinates; this is \\begin{align*} \\Delta_{LB} \u0026amp;= \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial X_{ii}^2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i \u0026lt; j}\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial \\text{Re}(X_{ij})^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial \\text{Im}(X_{ij})^2}\\right)\\\\\\ \u0026amp;= \\frac{1}{V^2(\\lambda)}\\sum_{i=1}^n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\lambda_i} \\left(V^2(\\lambda) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\lambda_i} \\cdot\\right) + (\\Delta \\textit{ on the angular coordinates}), \\end{align*} i.e., on only the eigenvalue coordinates, we have \\begin{equation}\\label{eigenvalue-laplacian} \\Delta_{eigenvalues} = \\frac{1}{V^2(\\lambda)}\\sum_{i=1}^n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\lambda_i} \\left(V^2(\\lambda) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\lambda_i} \\cdot\\right). \\end{equation}\n$1$. The Gaussian Unitary Ensemble \u0026amp; Planar Diagrams. We now demonstrate how certain integrals over $\\mathcal{H}$n can be related to enumeration of planar diagrams, a fact which was first noticed by the physicists E. Brezin, C. Itzykson, G. Parisi, \u0026amp; J. B. Zuber. Most of the results presented here are standard; they can be found in places like this paper by Phillipe Di Francesco, or in this one by Alexander Zvonkin, for example. Let $\\mathcal{H}$n denote the space of $n\\times n$ Hermitian matrices. We consider the measure \\begin{equation*} d\\mathbb{P}(X) = \\frac{1}{Z_n} e^{-\\frac{n}{2}\\text{tr} X^2} dX, \\end{equation*} where $dX$ is Haar measure on $\\mathcal{H}$n (which we have just defined in the previous section), and $Z_n$ is a normalization constant so that $\\int d\\mathbb{P} = 1$, called the \\textit{partition function}. The ensemble of such matrices, taken together with the probability measure $\\mathbb{P}$n, form the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE). We denote the expected value of a random variable $f(X):$ $\\mathcal{H}$n $\\to \\mathbb{R}$ in this ensemble by $\\langle f(X) \\rangle_n$; explicitly, \\begin{equation} \\langle f(X) \\rangle_n = \\frac{1}{Z_n} dX \\int_{H_n} f(X) e^{-\\frac{n}{2}\\text{tr} X^2}. \\end{equation} We wish to evaluate expected values of certain random variables in the large $n$ limit, in particular (Notice that $X\\in \\mathcal{H}$n is dependent on $n$ as well; we suppress dependence to simplify notations.) \\begin{equation} \\langle \\text{tr} X^k \\rangle:= \\lim_{n\\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{n}\\langle \\text{tr} X^k \\rangle_n. \\end{equation} We claim that \\begin{equation} \\langle \\text{tr} X^k \\rangle = C_k, \\end{equation} where $C_k = \\frac{1}{k+1}{2k \\choose k}$ is the $k^{th}$ Catalan number. This will follow from some combinatorial arguments. We begin by proving the following:\nTheorem 1.1 Let $S\\in \\mathcal{H}_n$ be a fixed matrix. Then, \\begin{equation} \\langle e^{\\text{tr} XS}\\rangle_n = e^{\\text{tr} S^2/2n}. \\end{equation}\nProof. We have that \\begin{align*} \\langle e^{\\text{tr} XS} \\rangle_n \u0026amp;= \\frac{1}{Z_n}\\int_{H_n}dX e^{-\\frac{n}{2}\\text{tr} (X^2 - \\frac{2}{n} XS)}\\\\\\ \u0026amp;= e^{\\text{tr} S^2/2n} \\frac{1}{Z_n}\\int_{H_n}dX e^{-\\frac{n}{2}\\text{tr} (X-S/n)^2} \\\\\\ \u0026amp;=e^{\\text{tr} S^2/2n} \\frac{1}{Z_n}\\int_{H_n}d(X-S/n) e^{-\\frac{n}{2}\\text{tr} (X-S/n)^2}\\\\\\ \u0026amp;= e^{\\text{tr} S^2/2n} \\frac{1}{Z_n}\\int_{H_n}dX e^{-\\frac{n}{2}\\text{tr} (X)^2} = e^{\\text{tr} S^2/2n}, \\end{align*} where in the last step, we used the fact that $dX$ is translation invariant.\n$\\square$  Consequentially, we can compute any expected value of interest by differentiating $f(S) := e^{\\text{tr} S^2/2n}$ with respect to $S$, and evaluating at $S=0$. For example, \\begin{align} \\langle X_{ij} \\rangle_n = \\frac{\\partial f(S)}{\\partial S_{ji}} \\bigg|_{S=0}, \\end{align}\nand \\begin{align} \\langle X_{i_1j_1}X_{i_2j_2} \\rangle_n = \\frac{\\partial^2 f(S)}{\\partial S_{j_1i_1}\\partial S_{j_2i_2}} \\bigg|_{S=0}. \\end{align}\nExplicitly, we have that\nLemma 1.1 For any indices $i_1,j_1,i_2,j_2$, \\begin{equation} \\langle X_{i_1j_1} \\rangle_n = 0, \\qquad \\qquad \\langle X_{i_1j_1}X_{i_2j_2}\\rangle_n = \\frac{1}{n} \\delta_{i_1 j_2}\\delta_{i_2 j_1}. \\end{equation} Proof. Note that the exponent of $f(S)$ is $\\frac{1}{2n}\\text{tr} S^2 = \\frac{1}{2n}\\sum_{k,l} S_{kl}S_{lk}$, and that \\begin{equation*} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial S_{j_1 i_1}}\\frac{1}{2n}\\sum_{k,l} S_{kl}S_{lk} = \\frac{1}{2n}\\sum_{k,l} \\left(\\delta_{k j_1}\\delta_{l i_1} S_{lk} + S_{kl}\\delta_{l j_1}\\delta_{k i_1}\\right) = \\frac{1}{n}S_{i_1 j_1}. \\end{equation*} Therefore, by the chain rule, \\begin{align} \\langle X_{i_1j_1}\\rangle_n = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial S_{j_1 i_1}}e^{\\text{tr} S^2/2n}=\\frac{1}{n}S_{i_1 j_1}e^{\\text{tr} S^2/2n}\\bigg|_{S=0} = 0. \\end{align}\nSimilarly, by the product rule, \\begin{align*} \\langle X_{i_1j_1}X_{i_2j_2} \\rangle_n \u0026amp;= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial S_{j_2 i_2}}\\frac{1}{n}S_{i_1 j_1}e^{\\text{tr} S^2/2n}\\bigg|{S=0} \\\\\\ \u0026amp;= \\frac{1}{n}\\delta{i_1 j_2}\\delta_{i_2 j_1}e^{\\text{tr} S^2/2n}\\bigg|{S=0} + \\frac{1}{n}S{i_1 j_1}S_{i_2 j_2}e^{\\text{tr} S^2/2n}\\bigg|{S=0}\\\\\\ \u0026amp;= \\frac{1}{n}\\delta{i_1 j_2}\\delta_{i_2 j_1}. \\end{align*}\n$\\square$  Furthermore, any \u0026ldquo;higher\u0026rdquo; expected value can be computed via Wick\u0026rsquo;s theorem}:\nTheorem 1.2. (Wick\u0026rsquo;s Theorem.) Let $I = {(i_1,j_1),\\cdots (i_{2M},j_{2M})}$ be a collection of indices, $1 \\leq i_k,j_k \\leq n$. Then, \\begin{equation} \\langle \\prod_{(i,j) \\in I}X_{ij} \\rangle_n = \\sum_{\\pi \\in \\Pi_{2M}} \\prod_{(i,j),(k,l)\\in \\pi} \\langle X_{i j}X_{k l}\\rangle_n, \\end{equation} where $\\Pi_{2M}$ is the set of all pairings of the index set $I$.\nFor example, we have that \\begin{align*} \\langle X_{i_1 j_1} X_{i_2 j_2} X_{i_3 j_3} X_{i_4 j_4}\\rangle_n \u0026amp;= \\langle X_{i_1 j_1} X_{i_2 j_2}\\rangle_n \\langle X_{i_3 j_3} X_{i_4 j_4}\\rangle_n\\\\\\ \u0026amp;+\\langle X_{i_1 j_1} X_{i_3 j_3}\\rangle_n \\langle X_{i_2 j_2} X_{i_4 j_4}\\rangle_n\\\\\\ \u0026amp;+ \\langle X_{i_1 j_1} X_{i_4 j_4}\\rangle_n\\langle X_{i_2 j_2} X_{i_3 j_3}\\rangle_n. \\end{align*}\nProof. (Sketch.) The theorem follows from the fact that derivatives must come in pairs for nonzero contributions to the expected value to appear; see the proof of the lemma. It is clear that the sum must be taken over all such pairings. The full proof of this fact is given in Zvonkin\u0026rsquo;s survey.\n$\\square$  Corollary 1.1 The expected value of the product of an odd number of matrix elements is necessarily zero.\nUsing the above theorems, we are now able to compute expected values of quantities like $\\langle \\text{tr} X^k \\rangle_n$. By the corollary, we trivially have that $\\langle \\text{tr} X^{2k+1}\\rangle_n = 0$; it remains to compute the traces of even powers. This can be accomplished by realizing the pairings in Wick\u0026rsquo;s theorem as sums over families of $1$- face maps. We briefly summarize these results. Let us begin by way of example. Consider the expected value $\\langle\\text{tr} X^4 \\rangle_n$; we have that, by linearity of $\\langle \\cdot \\rangle_n$: \\begin{equation*} \\langle \\text{tr} X^4 \\rangle_n = \\sum_{i_1, \\cdots, i_4} \\langle X_{i_1 i_2} X_{i_2 i_3} X_{i_3 i_4} X_{i_4 i_1} \\rangle_n. \\end{equation*} Using Wick\u0026rsquo;s theorem, we see that there are $3$ contributing terms in the above sum: \\begin{align*} \\langle X_{i_1 i_2} X_{i_2 i_3}\\rangle_n \u0026amp;\\langle X_{i_3 i_4} X_{i_4 i_1}\\rangle_n,\\quad \\langle X_{i_1 i_2} X_{i_3 i_4}\\rangle_n \\langle X_{i_2 i_3} X_{i_4 i_1}\\rangle_n,\\quad \\text{and }\\\\\\ \u0026amp;\\langle X_{i_1 i_2} X_{i_4 i_1}\\rangle_n \\langle X_{i_2 i_3} X_{i_3 i_4}\\rangle_n. \\end{align*} We will deal with each of these contributions separately. By Lemma 1.1, we see that the first term is only nonvanishing if $i_1 = i_3$; this leaves three free indices, so that \\begin{equation} \\label{termA} \\sum_{i_1, \\cdots, i_4}\\langle X_{i_1 i_2} X_{i_2 i_3}\\rangle_n \\langle X_{i_3 i_4} X_{i_4 i_1}\\rangle_n = \\sum_{i_1, i_2, i_3} \\frac{1}{n}\\cdot\\frac{1}{n} = n. \\end{equation} Again by Lemma 1.1, we see that the second term $\\langle X_{i_1 i_2} X_{i_3 i_4}\\rangle_n \\langle X_{i_2 i_3} X_{i_4 i_1}\\rangle_n$ is only nonvanishing if $i_1 = i_2 = i_3 = i_4$, leaving only one free index, so that this term contributes a total factor of $\\frac{1}{n}$: \\begin{equation}\\label{termB} \\sum_{i_1, \\cdots, i_4} \\langle X_{i_1 i_2} X_{i_3 i_4}\\rangle_n \\langle X_{i_2 i_3} X_{i_4 i_1}\\rangle_n = \\sum_{i_1} \\frac{1}{n}\\cdot\\frac{1}{n} = \\frac{1}{n}. \\end{equation} Finally, the last term in the sum, $\\langle X_{i_1 i_2} X_{i_4 i_1}\\rangle_n \\langle X_{i_2 i_3} X_{i_3 i_4}\\rangle_n$, similarly contributes a factor of $n$, since the only constraint on indices here is $i_2 = i_4$, by the lemma: \\begin{equation}\\label{termC} \\sum_{i_1, \\cdots, i_4} \\langle X_{i_1 i_2} X_{i_4 i_1}\\rangle_n \\langle X_{i_2 i_3} X_{i_3 i_4} \\rangle_n = n. \\end{equation} Combining the results above, we find that \\begin{equation} \\frac{1}{n}\\langle X^4 \\rangle_n = \\frac{1}{n}\\left(n + \\frac{1}{n} + n\\right) = 2 + \\frac{1}{n^2}; \\end{equation} Thus, we can easily compute the large $n$ limit: $\\lim_{n\\to \\infty}\\frac{1}{n} \\langle X^4\\rangle_n = 2$, which is indeed the second Catalan number.\nThe above computation is essentially generic; one computes $\\langle X^{2k} \\rangle_n$ by first applying Wick\u0026rsquo;s formula, then computing the individual contributions of each pairing by investigating the number of free indices, and finally by summing these contributions. In fact, the problem is essentially reduced to counting the number of pairings that give only one free index, among the $(2k-1)!!$ possible pairings appearing in the sum. We can count the number of such pairings using the following geometric interpretation of each of the terms. Consider the Wick expansion of the trace $\\langle\\text{tr} X^{m}\\rangle_n$; a generic term in this expansion will consist of a product of \u0026ldquo;pair correlations\u0026rdquo;, i.e., expected values of pairs of matrix elements: $\\langle X_{i j}X_{k l}\\rangle_n$. We draw a diagram with $n$ \u0026ldquo;half edges\u0026rdquo;, as seen here:\nTo each term in the Wick expansion of $\\langle \\text{tr} X^{m} \\rangle_n$, we associate one of these diagrams: if $(i_N,j_N)$ is paired $(i_M,j_M)$, we connect the corresponding half-edges to form a full edge. The diagrams can then be used to compute the contribution of each term in the expansion. For example, two possible pairings appearing in the Wick expansion of $\\langle\\text{tr} X^6\\rangle_n$ are depicted below.\nThe leftmost diagram corresponds to the term $\\langle X_{i_1 i_2}X_{i_2 i_3}\\rangle_n \\langle X_{i_3 i_4}X_{i_4 i_5}\\rangle_n \\langle X_{i_5 i_6}X_{i_6 i_1} \\rangle_n$; we see that this term is only nonvanishing when $i_1=i_3=i_5$, and for any $i_2,i_4,i_6$. Thus, the diagram contributes a factor of $n$ to $\\langle \\textit{tr} X^6 \\rangle_n$. On the other hand, the diagram on the right corresponds to the pairing $\\langle X_{i_1 i_2}X_{i_3 i_4}\\rangle_n \\langle X_{i_2 i_3}X_{i_6 i_1}\\rangle_n \\langle X_{i_4 i_5}X_{i_6 i_6}\\rangle_n$, which is only nonvanishing when $i_1 = i_4 = i_6 = i_3 = i_2$, and for any $i_5$. It follows that this diagram contributes a factor of $1/n$, which will vanish in the large $n$ limit, as the diagram is non-planar.\nFinally, we can conclude that\nTheorem 1.3. \\begin{equation} \\langle\\text{tr} X^{2k}\\rangle_n = \\sum_{g=0}^{[k/2]} \\varepsilon_g(k) n^{1-2g}, \\end{equation} where $\\varepsilon_g(k)$ is the number of labelled one-face maps with $k$ edges of genus $g$.\nIn particular, \\begin{equation} \\frac{1}{n}\\langle \\text{tr} X^{2k}\\rangle_n = \\varepsilon_0(k) + o(1/n), \\end{equation} where $\\varepsilon_0(k)$ is the number of planar labelled one-face maps with $k$ edges. For this reason, the large $n$ limit is sometimes referred to as the planar limit. It is well-known that $\\varepsilon_0(k) = C_k$, the $k^{th}$ Catalan number.\n$2.$ Matrix Ensembles and Orthogonal Polynomials. Most computations within the scheme matrix ensembles are performed with techniques from the theory of orthogonal polynomials. Let us illustrate this connection in several different ways. Let us consider the Hermitian ensemble with measure \\begin{equation*} \\label{V-ensemble} d\\mathbb{P}n(X) = \\frac{1}{Z_n} e^{-\\text{tr} Q(X)} dX, \\end{equation*} where $Q(X) = X^{2n} + \\cdots$ is a monic polynomial of even degree. Along with this ensemble, we also consider the family of monic orthogonal polynomials ${\\pi_n(\\lambda)}$, which satisfy the relation \\begin{equation}\\label{Q-OP} (\\pi_m,\\pi_n) := \\int{\\mathbb{R}}d\\lambda e^{-Q(\\lambda)} \\pi_n(\\lambda)\\pi_m(\\lambda) = h_n \\delta_{nm}, \\end{equation} where $V(\\lambda)$ is the same polynomial, but in the real variable $\\lambda$ instead of the matrix variable $X$. Our first connection between the ensemble defined by the above measure and the polynomials ${\\pi_n(\\lambda)}$ is given by the following theorem:\nTheorem 2.1. (Heine\u0026rsquo;s formula) The polynomials $\\pi_n(x)$ satisfy \\begin{equation} \\pi_n(\\lambda) = \\langle \\det(\\lambda - X)\\rangle_n. \\end{equation}\nProof. The proof is rather straightforward; first, it is clear from its definition that the right hand side of the above equation is a monic polynomial of degree $n$. Thus, we have only to show that this polynomial is orthogonal to $\\lambda^m$, for $0 \\leq m \\leq n$. Suppose this is the case; then, \\begin{align*} Z_n \\cdot \\big(\\lambda^m, \\langle \\det(\\lambda - X)n\\big) \u0026amp;= \\int{\\mathbb{R}} d\\lambda e^{-Q(\\lambda)} \\lambda^m\\bigg[ \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n}\\prod_{i=1}^n d\\lambda_i (\\lambda - \\lambda_i)e^{-Q(\\lambda_i)} V^2(\\lambda_1,\\cdots,\\lambda_n) \\bigg] ; \\end{align*} Note that $V(\\lambda_1,\\cdots,\\lambda_n)\\prod_{i=1}^n(\\lambda - \\lambda_i) = V(\\lambda_1,\\cdots,\\lambda_n,\\lambda)$, the Vandermonde determinant with one extra variable. Furthermore, the remaining piece of the integrand, $V(\\lambda_1,\\cdots,\\lambda_n)\\lambda^m$, can be rewritten as (labelling $\\lambda = \\lambda_{n+1}$): \\begin{equation*} V(\\lambda_1,\\cdots,\\lambda_n)\\lambda^m = \\frac{1}{n+1}\\sum_{i=1}^{n+1} (-1)^{i+n+1} V(\\lambda_1,\\cdots, \\hat{\\lambda_i},\\cdots,\\lambda_{n+1})\\lambda_i^m; \\end{equation*} This is the expression for the determinant \\begin{equation*} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \u0026amp; \\lambda_1 \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; \\lambda_1^{n-1} \u0026amp;\\lambda_1^m\\\\\\ 1 \u0026amp; \\lambda_2 \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; \\lambda_2^{n-1} \u0026amp;\\lambda_2^m\\\\\\ \\vdots \u0026amp; \\vdots \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; \\ddots \u0026amp;\\vdots\\\\\\ 1 \u0026amp; \\lambda_{n+1} \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; \\lambda_{n+1}^{n-1} \u0026amp;\\lambda_{n+1}^m\\\\\\ \\end{pmatrix}; \\end{equation*} Clearly, this expression vanishes if $m \u0026lt; n$, and so $\\det(\\lambda - X)_n$ is orthogonal to the first $m$ monomials, and is thus the (unique) monic orthogonal polynomial, $\\pi_n(\\lambda)$.\n$\\square$  In the above proof, if $m=n$, by what we just argued, we have that \\begin{align*} Z_n \\cdot \\big(\\lambda^n, \\langle \\det(\\lambda - X)n\\big) \u0026amp;= \\frac{1}{n+1}\\int{\\mathbb{R}}d\\lambda e^{-Q(\\lambda)} \\bigg[ \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n}\\prod_{i=1}^n d\\lambda_i e^{-Q(\\lambda_i)} V^2(\\lambda_1,\\cdots,\\lambda_n,\\lambda) \\bigg] \\\\\\ \u0026amp;= \\frac{1}{n+1} Z_{n+1}; \\end{align*} furthermore, since $\\big(\\lambda^n, \\langle \\det(\\lambda - X)\\rangle_n\\big) = \\big(\\lambda^n, \\pi_n\\big) = (\\pi_n, \\pi_n) = h_n$, we obtain that \\begin{equation*} Z_{n+1} = (n+1)h_n; \\end{equation*} We therefore obtain inductively a second important link between orthogonal polynomials and matrix models:\nTheorem 2.2. The partition function of the matrix model defined above is related to the orthogonality constants ${h_k}$ by \\begin{equation} Z_n = n! \\prod_{k=0}^n h_k. \\end{equation}\nWe wish to make one final connection between matrix models and orthogonal polynomials. Consider the probability density function on the eigenvalues for this ensemble: \\begin{equation} \\rho_n(\\lambda_1,\\cdots, \\lambda_n) := \\frac{1}{Z_n} V^2(\\lambda_1 ,\\cdots,\\lambda_n) e^{-\\sum_{k=1}^n Q(\\lambda_k)}. \\end{equation} Recall that the Vandermonde determinant is the determinant of the matrix $\\big(\\lambda_i^{j-1} \\big)$. Note that we can add any scalar multiple of any row/column to any other row/column without changing the determinant; thus, \\begin{equation*} \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \u0026amp; \\lambda_1 \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; \\lambda_1^{n-1}\\\\\\ 1 \u0026amp; \\lambda_2 \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; \\lambda_2^{n-1}\\\\\\ \\vdots \u0026amp; \\vdots \u0026amp; \\ddots \u0026amp;\\vdots\\\\\\ 1 \u0026amp; \\lambda_{n} \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; \\lambda_{n}^{n-1}\\\\\\ \\end{pmatrix} = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} p_0(\\lambda_1) \u0026amp; p_1(\\lambda_1) \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; p_{n-1}(\\lambda_1)\\\\\\ p_0(\\lambda_2) \u0026amp; p_1(\\lambda_2) \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; p_{n-1}(\\lambda_2)\\\\\\ \\vdots \u0026amp; \\vdots \u0026amp; \\ddots \u0026amp;\\vdots\\\\\\ p_0(\\lambda_n) \u0026amp; p_1(\\lambda_n) \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; p_{n-1}(\\lambda_n)\\\\\\ \\end{pmatrix}, \\end{equation*} for any family of monic polynomials ${p_{k}(\\lambda)}$. In particular, we will choose $p_{k}(\\lambda) = \\pi_k(\\lambda)$, the monic orthogonal polynomials with respect to the weight $e^{Q(\\lambda)}$. Combining these two determinants, the density function becomes \\begin{align*} \\rho_n(\\lambda_1,\\cdots, \\lambda_n) \u0026amp;= \\frac{1}{Z_n} \\det(\\pi_k(\\lambda_i))\\det(\\pi_k(\\lambda_j)) e^{-\\sum_{k=1}^n Q(\\lambda_k)}\\\\\\ \u0026amp;=\\frac{1}{n! \\prod_{k=0}^n h_k} \\det\\bigg(\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\pi_k(\\lambda_i)\\pi_k(\\lambda_j)\\bigg) e^{-\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} Q(\\lambda_k)}\\\\\\ \u0026amp;=\\frac{1}{n!} \\det\\bigg(\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\frac{\\pi_k(\\lambda_i)\\pi_k(\\lambda_j)}{h_k}\\bigg)e^{-\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} Q(\\lambda_k)}\\\\\\ \u0026amp;=\\frac{1}{n!} \\det\\bigg(\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\frac{\\pi_k(\\lambda_i)e^{-Q(\\lambda_i)/2}\\pi_k(\\lambda_j)e^{-Q(\\lambda_j)/2}}{h_k}\\bigg)\\\\\\ \u0026amp;:=\\frac{1}{n!}\\det(K(\\lambda_i,\\lambda_j)). \\end{align*} The function \\begin{equation} K(\\lambda,\\mu) := \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\frac{\\pi_k(\\lambda)\\pi_k(\\mu)}{h_k}e^{-Q(\\lambda)/2}e^{-Q(\\mu)/2} \\end{equation} is called the Christoffel-Darboux kernel; it acts as a projector onto the span of the first $n$ orthogonal polynomials, multiplied by $e^{Q/2}$. If $m \u0026lt; n$, integrating out the last $(n-m)$ variables, one finds that the joint density of the first $m$ eigenvalues is \\begin{equation} \\rho_n(\\lambda_1,\\cdots,\\lambda_m) = \\frac{(n-m)!}{n!} \\det(K(\\lambda_i,\\lambda_j))_{i,j = 1}^m. \\end{equation}\n$3.$ Coulomb Gas Formalism. In random matrix theory, one is often interested in the large n (planar) limit of certain quantities; by the previous section, we are equivalently looking for asymptotic formulae for orthogonal polynomials. One technique for addressing such questions is the coulomb gas method. For sake of clarity, we will focus our attention on one particular object, and its asymptotics: the free energy: \\begin{align*} F = \\frac{1}{n^2}\\log Z_n = \\frac{1}{n^2} \\log \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} V(\\lambda_1,\\cdots,\\lambda_n) e^{-n\\sum_{i=1}^nQ(\\lambda_i)} d\\lambda_1\\cdots d\\lambda_n. \\end{align*} Moving the Vandermonde determinant into the exponent, we can rewrite the free energy as \\begin{align*} \\frac{1}{n^2} \\log \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} e^{-n^2 E(\\lambda_1,\\cdots,\\lambda_n)}d\\lambda_1\\cdots d\\lambda_n, \\end{align*} where \\begin{equation} E(\\lambda_1,\\cdots,\\lambda_n) := \\frac{1}{n^2}\\sum_{i\\neq j} \\log \\frac{1}{\\lambda_i - \\lambda_j} + \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n Q(\\lambda_i). \\end{equation} The above sum can be interpreted as an energy functional for a system of $n$ charges interacting via the $2D$ Coulomb potential. The fact that the $\\lambda_i\u0026rsquo;s$ are real translates to the condition that the charges are confined to live on a wire (the real line). The charges all have mass $1/n$, and all have the same sign, and so the affect of the coulomb interaction is repulsive. On the other hand, the charges sit in a background confining potential $Q(\\lambda)$, which holds them together. Note that both terms in $E(\\lambda_1,\\cdots,\\lambda_n)$ are of order 1, by how we scaled $Q\\to nQ$.\nWith this interpetation in mind, let us turn our attention back to the free energy. When $n$ is very large, typical saddle point analysis tells us that we expect the dominant contributions to the free energy to come from the minima of $E$, i.e. \\begin{align*} F \u0026amp;= \\frac{1}{n^2} \\log \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} e^{-n^2E(\\lambda_1,\\cdots\\lambda_n)} d\\lambda_1\\cdots d\\lambda_n\\\\\\ \u0026amp;\\sim \\frac{1}{n^2} \\log e^{-n^2 \\min E(\\lambda_1,\\cdots\\lambda_n)}\\\\\\ \u0026amp;= \\min E(\\lambda_1,\\cdots\\lambda_n). \\end{align*} Writing the density of charges as a measure $\\mu = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{k=1}^n \\delta_{{\\lambda_{k}}}$, we can rewrite this minimization problem as \\begin{align*} \\min E(\\lambda_1,\\cdots\\lambda_n) \u0026amp;= \\min \\frac{1}{n^2}\\sum_{i\\neq j} \\log \\frac{1}{\\lambda_i - \\lambda_j} + \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n Q(\\lambda_i)\\\\\\ \u0026amp;= \\min_{\\mu(\\mathbb{R}) = 1} \\int\\int \\log\\frac{1}{x-y} d\\mu(x) d\\mu(y) + \\int Q(x) d\\mu(x). \\end{align*} As $n \\to \\infty$, we expect that the charges should coalesce into a continuous distribution of charge $\\mu$, i.e., $ \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{k=1}^n \\delta_{{\\lambda_{k}}} \\to \\rho(x) dx$, where $\\rho$ has total charge $1$. This sort of equilibrium problem is well-known in potential theory; we can use our physical intuition to try and find its solution. In equilibrium, the effective potential (the potential coming from the charges themselves, plus the external field) should be constant on the support of the charges, otherwise the charges would move around, and we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be in equilibrium. This yields the following equilibrium condition: \\begin{equation} U^\\mu(x) + Q(x) = \\text{const.}, \\end{equation} for $x$ in the support of the charges. Here, $U^\\mu(x)$ is the potential given off by the charges: \\begin{equation} U^\\mu(x) = \\int \\log\\frac{1}{x-y} d\\mu(y). \\end{equation} Differentiating the equilibrium condition, we obtain the equation \\begin{equation} C^\\mu(x) + Q'(x) = 0, \\end{equation} where $C^\\mu(x)$ is the Cauchy transform of the measure $\\mu$: \\begin{equation} C^\\mu(x) = \\int \\frac{d\\mu(y)}{y-x}, \\end{equation} considered here in the principal value sense. We are almost at our goal; all that remains is to recover the measure $\\mu$ from the above formula, and then plug it back in to the energy functional, and then we have our expression for the dominant contribution to the free energy. But how do we recover a measure if we know its Cauchy transform? Luckily, this question has already been answered for us; these are the famous Sokhotsky-Plemelj formulae: \\begin{align*} \\frac{d\\mu(x)}{dx} \u0026amp;= \\frac{1}{2\\pi i}\\bigg( C^\\mu_+(x) - C^\\mu_-(x)\\bigg),\\\\\\ P.V.\\int \\frac{d\\mu(y)}{y-x} \u0026amp;= C^\\mu_+(x) + C^\\mu_-(x), \\end{align*} for $x$ in the support of the charges. These formulae, along with a little knowledge of complex analysis, will allow us to recover $d\\mu(x) = \\rho(x)dx$. Consider the function $P(z):=Q'(z)C^{\\mu}(z) - (C^\\mu(z))^2$. This function is analytic everywhere in the complex plane, except possibly at the places where $C^\\mu(z)$ loses analyticity\u0026ndash;the support of the charges. Let us compute the jump of $P(z)$ across the support: \\begin{align*} P_+(z) - P_-(z) \u0026amp;= Q'(z)\\bigg(C^{\\mu}+(z)-C^{\\mu}-(z)\\bigg) - (C^\\mu_+(z))^2 + (C^\\mu_-(z))^2\\\\\\ \u0026amp;= \\bigg(C^{\\mu}+(z)+C^{\\mu}-(z)\\bigg)\\bigg(C^{\\mu}+(z)-C^{\\mu}-(z)\\bigg)- (C^\\mu_+(z))^2 + (C^\\mu_-(z))^2\\\\\\ \u0026amp;=0, \\end{align*} and so $P(z)$ is continuous across the support of the charges, and thus continuous everywhere. By Morera\u0026rsquo;s theorem, $P(z)$ is an entire function. Furthermore, we know the exact growth rate of $P(z)$ at infinity: $P(z) = \\mathcal{O}(z^{n-2})$, where $\\deg Q = n$. Thus, by Liouville\u0026rsquo;s theorem, $P(z)$ is a polynomial of degree $n-2$. We thus have obtained an algebraic equation for $C^\\mu(z)$: \\begin{equation} (C^\\mu(z))^2 - Q'(z)C^{\\mu}(z) - P(z) = 0; \\end{equation} this equation is quadratic in $C^\\mu(z)$, and thus can be solved: \\begin{equation} C^{\\mu}(z) = -\\frac{1}{2}Q'(z) \\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{Q'(z)^2 - 4P(z) \\end{equation} Therefore, by the other half of the Sokhotsky-Plemelj formulae, we can recover the density: \\begin{equation} \\rho(x) = \\frac{d\\mu(x)}{dx} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\sqrt{4P(x) - Q'(x)^2}. \\end{equation} In practice, computing the coefficients of $P(x)$ is not a trivial task, especially if the support of the measure is more than one interval. However, if the potential $Q(x)$ is partiularly simple, the computations can be done rather quickly; if $Q(x) = \\frac{1}{2}x^2$, as it is for the GUE, then it is easy to see that $P(x) = 1$, and so the formula above becomes \\begin{equation} \\rho(x) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\sqrt{4-x^2}; \\end{equation} this is Wigner\u0026rsquo;s semicircle law.\n$4.$ 2-Matrix Models. We now discuss $N$-matrix models, which are matrix models $n$ over copies of $\\mathcal{H}$n; for simplicity, we specialize to the case of $N = 2$. We denote the matrices in the first copy of $\\mathcal{H}$n by $A$, and in the second copy by $B$. The probability measure we consider here is \\begin{equation*} d\\mathbb{P}n(A,B) = \\frac{1}{Z_n} \\exp\\bigg( -\\frac{n}{2} \\text{tr} (A^2 + B^2 + 2cAB)\\bigg) dA dB. \\end{equation*} The quantity in the exponent can be thought of as a quadratic form on pairs of Hermitian matrices $(A,B)$, with defining matrix \\begin{equation*} \\label{quad-form} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \u0026amp; c \\\\\\ c \u0026amp; 1 \\end{pmatrix}. \\end{equation*} Expected values are denoted in the same way as before; this ensemble is also Gaussian in nature, and so the matrix version of Wick\u0026rsquo;s theorem applies. As before, all one-point functions vanish identically. Thus, the relevant expected values to compute are the two-point functions; they are: \\begin{align*} \\langle A{i_1j_1}A_{i_2j_2}\\rangle_n = \\langle B_{i_1j_1}B_{i_2j_2}\\rangle_n \u0026amp;= \\frac{1}{n}\\frac{1}{1-c^2} \\delta_{i_1 j_2}\\delta_{i_2 j_1},\\\\\\ \\langle A_{i_1j_1}B_{i_2j_2}\\rangle_n \u0026amp;= \\frac{1}{n}\\frac{c}{1-c^2} \\delta_{i_1 j_2}\\delta_{i_2 j_1}. \\end{align*} The computations are almost identical to the $1$-matrix case, and so we omit them here (the process involves the extra step of diagonalizing the quadratic form above. The crucial point here is that the two point functions for \u0026ldquo;like\u0026rdquo; matrices are the same, and differ from the two point function for the \u0026ldquo;mismatched\u0026rdquo; matrices by an overall constant. Therefore, the same sorts of combinatorial identites that held before for the correlations now hold for graphs with two possible weights on the vertices.\nThis connection of the 2-matrix model to enumeration of 2-colored graphs was exploited by V. Kazakov to answer questions about the Ising model on random planar graphs.\n$5.$ Itzykson-Zuber Integral over the Unitary Group. With this combinatorial interpretation of the model in mind, we would like to go about explicitly computing certain matrix integrals. To do this, we will need to switch over to eigenvalue variables; this is not as trivial as a task as it was in the 1-matrix case. This is made apparent as follows. Suppose we want to compute the expected value of some function $f(A,B) = f(\\text{tr} A,\\text{tr} B)$. This is written as \\begin{equation} \\langle f(A,B) \\rangle_n = \\frac{1}{Z_n}\\int_{A\\in \\mathcal{H}n} \\int{B \\in \\mathcal{H}n}dA dB \\exp\\bigg( -\\frac{n}{2} \\text{tr} (A^2 + B^2 + 2cAB)\\bigg) f(A,B). \\end{equation} Letting $A = U^\\dagger X U$, $B = V^\\dagger Y V$, where $X = \\text{diag}(x_1,\\cdots,x_n)$, $Y = \\text{diag}(y_1,\\cdots,y_n)$ are diagonal matrices, we see that the above is \\begin{align*} =\u0026amp; \\frac{1}{Z_n}\\int{X,Y\\in \\mathbb{R}^n} dX dY V(X)^2V(Y)^2f(X,Y) \\exp\\bigg( -\\frac{n}{2} \\text{tr} (X^2 + Y^2)\\bigg) \\\\\\ \u0026amp;\\times\\int_{U,V \\in U(n)/U_{diag}(n)} dU dV \\exp\\big(nc \\text{tr} AB\\big) \\end{align*} We must pay careful attention to the integral \\begin{equation*} \\int_{U,V \\in U(n)/U_{diag}(n)} dU dV \\exp\\big(nc \\text{tr} AB\\big) = \\int_{U,V \\in U(n)/U_{diag}(n)} dU dV \\exp\\big(nc \\text{tr} U^\\dagger X UV^\\dagger Y V\\big). \\end{equation*} Making the change of variables in $V$: $W = UV^\\dagger$, and integrating over $U$ first (and applying translation invariance of the Haar measure), we see that the above integral becomes \\begin{equation} \\text{vol}(U(n)/U_{diag}(n)) \\cdot \\int_{W \\in U(n)/U_{diag}(n)} dW \\exp\\big(nc \\text{tr} X W Y W^\\dagger\\big), \\end{equation} where $X,Y$ are diagonal matrices, and $W$ is unitary. Integrals of this type are called Harish-Chandra or Itzykson-Zuber integrals over the unitary group. It turns out that such integrals can be computed explicitly. We will consider here a slight generalization of the above: \\begin{equation} I(A,B;s) := \\int_{U(n)/U_{diag}(n)} dU \\exp\\big(s \\text{tr} A U B U^\\dagger\\big), \\end{equation} where $A, B$ are Hermitian matrices. Our claim is the following:\nTheorem 5.1. Let $I(A,B;s)$ be as defined above, and suppose $A$ has eigenvalues $a_1,\\cdots, a_n$, and $B$ has eigenvalues $b_1,\\cdots, b_n$. Then \\begin{equation} I(A,B;s) = s^{-n(n-1)/2} \\frac{\\det(e^{a_ib_j})}{V(a) V(b)}. \\end{equation}\nThe remainder of this section is dedicated to a proof of this fact. We use the heat kernel technique, which is outlined in a wonderful paper by P. Zinn-Justin and J.B. Zuber. Consider the heat equation in the variable $A$: \\begin{equation}\\label{heat-eq-1} \\begin{cases} \\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - \\frac{1}{2} \\Delta_A \\right) u(A,t) = 0,\\\\\\ u(A,0) = f(A). \\end{cases} \\end{equation} Here, $\\Delta_A$ is the usual Laplace operator on $\\mathcal{H}n$: \\begin{equation*} \\Delta{A} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial A_{ii}^2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i \u0026lt; j}\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial \\text{Re}(A_{ij})^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial \\text{Im}(A_{ij})^2}\\right). \\end{equation*} The heat kernel for this operator is easily derived (since $\\mathcal{H}n \\cong \\mathbb{R}^{n^2}$ in scaled coordinates): \\begin{equation*} K(A,B;t) = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi t)^{n^2/2}}\\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{2t} \\text{tr}(A-B)^2\\right); \\end{equation*} The solution to the heat equation above is thus given by \\begin{equation*} u(A,t) = \\int{\\mathcal{H}n} dB f(B) \\frac{1}{(2\\pi t)^{n^2/2}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2t} \\text{tr}(A-B)^2\\right). \\end{equation*} Let us suppose the initial data $f(A)$ depends only on the eigenvalue variables, i.e. $f(A) = f(\\text{tr}(A))$. Then, converting the above to eigenvalue variables $A = U^\\dagger X U$, $B = V^\\dagger Y V$, we find that \\begin{align*}\\label{heat2} u(A,t) = \u0026amp;\\frac{1}{(2\\pi t)^{n^2/2}}\\int{\\mathbb{R}^n} dY, V^2(Y)f(Y) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2t} \\text{tr}(X^2 + Y^2) \\right) \\\\\\ \u0026amp;\\times\\int_{U(n)/U_{diag}(n)} dW \\exp\\big(\\frac{1}{t} \\text{tr} X W Y W^\\dagger\\big), \\end{align*} where $W = UV^\\dagger$. Note that the inner integral is the object we want to compute. Furthermore, the above formula implies that if $f(U^\\dagger X U) = f(X)$, then $u(U^\\dagger X U,t) = u(X,t)$ for all $t \u0026gt; 0$ as well. Let us see examine the above equation in eigenvalue coordinates. With the help of the formula we derived for the laplacian on the eigenvalue coordinates, we find that \\begin{align*} 0 \u0026amp;= \\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - \\frac{1}{2} \\Delta_A \\right) u(A,t) = \\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - \\frac{1}{2} \\Delta_{X} \\right) u(X,t)\\\\\\ \u0026amp;= \\frac{\\partial u }{\\partial t} - \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{1}{V^2(X)}\\sum_{i=1}^n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i} \\left(V^2(X) \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x_i} \\right)\\\\\\ \u0026amp;= \\frac{\\partial u }{\\partial t} - \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{1}{V^2(X)}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(2V(X)\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x_i} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x_i} + V^2(X) \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x_i^2}\\right); \\end{align*} Multiplying the above equation by the Vandermonde determinant $V(x)$, and using the fact that $\\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x_i^2}= 0$, the above equation becomes \\begin{align*} 0 \u0026amp;= \\frac{\\partial V u }{\\partial t} - \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(2\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x_i} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x_i} + V(X)\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x_i^2}\\right)\\\\\\ \u0026amp;= \\frac{\\partial V u }{\\partial t} - \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(\\underbrace{u\\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x_i^2}}{=0} + 2\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x_i} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x_i} + V(X)\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x_i^2}\\right)\\\\\\ \u0026amp;= \\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - \\frac{1}{2} \\sum{i=1}^n \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x_i^2}\\right)V(X)u(X,t), \\end{align*} and so $V(x)u(X,t)$ satisfies a heat equation of a different form. The generic solution for initial data $g(X)$ to the above heat equation is \\begin{equation*} h(X,t) = \\int_{Y\\in \\mathbb{R}^n} dY \\frac{1}{(2\\pi t)^{n/2}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2t}\\text{tr}(X-Y)^2\\right) g(Y); \\end{equation*} In particular, for initial data $g(X) = V(X)f(X)$, we obtain the formula \\begin{equation}\\label{heat3} V(X)u(X,t) = \\int_{Y\\in \\mathbb{R}^n} dY \\frac{1}{(2\\pi t)^{n/2}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2t}\\text{tr}(X-Y)^2\\right) V(Y)f(Y) \\end{equation} multiplying the previous equation by $V(X)$, we see that we have two expressions for the same function, $V(X)u(X,t)$. Equating these expressions yields \\begin{align*} \u0026amp;V(X)\\frac{1}{(2\\pi t)^{n^2/2}}\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} dY V^2(Y)f(Y) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2t} \\text{tr}(X^2 + Y^2) \\right) \\int_{U(n)/U_{diag}(n)} dW \\exp\\big(\\frac{1}{t} \\text{tr} X W Y W^\\dagger\\big)\\\\\\ \u0026amp;= u(X,t)=\\int_{Y\\in \\mathbb{R}^n} dY \\frac{1}{(2\\pi t)^{n/2}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2t}\\text{tr}(X-Y)^2\\right) V(Y)f(Y). \\end{align*} Setting $f(Y) = \\delta(Y-Y_0)$, we obtain that \\begin{align*} \u0026amp;V(X)V^2(Y_0)\\frac{1}{(2\\pi t)^{n^2/2}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2t} \\text{tr}(X^2 + Y_0^2) \\right) \\int_{U(n)/U_{diag}(n)} dW \\exp\\big(\\frac{1}{t} \\text{tr} X W Y_0 W^\\dagger\\big)\\\\\\ \u0026amp;= \\frac{1}{(2\\pi t)^{n/2}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2t}\\text{tr}(X-Y_0)^2\\right) V(Y_0). \\end{align*} Rearranging, and relabelling $Y_0 = Y$, we get \\begin{equation*} \\int_{U(n)/U_{diag}(n)} dW \\exp\\big(\\frac{1}{t} \\text{tr} X W Y W^\\dagger\\big) = (2\\pi t)^{-n(n-1)/2}\\frac{\\exp(\\frac{1}{t}\\text{tr} XY)}{V(Y) V(X)}; \\end{equation*} finally, \\begin{equation} \\int_{U(n)/U_{diag}(n)} dW \\exp\\big(\\frac{1}{t} \\text{tr} X W Y W^\\dagger\\big) = (2\\pi t)^{-n(n-1)/2}\\frac{\\det e^{\\frac{1}{t}x_iy_j }}{V(Y) V(X)}. \\end{equation}\n$6.$ 2-Matrix Models and Biorthogonal Polynomials. Just as $1$-matrix models are connected to orthogonal polynomials, $2$-matrix models are connected to biorthogonal polynomials. Consider again the $2$-matrix model defined by the measure \\begin{equation*} d\\mathbb{P}n(A,B) = \\frac{1}{Z_n} \\exp\\bigg( -\\frac{n}{2} \\text{tr} (A^2 + B^2 + 2cAB)\\bigg) dA dB, \\end{equation*} and recall that expected values of invariant functions $f(A,B) = f(\\text{tr}(A),\\text{tr}(B))$ are given by the formula \\begin{equation*} \\langle f(A,B) \\rangle_n = \\frac{1}{Z_n}\\int{A\\in \\mathcal{H}n} \\int{B \\in \\mathcal{H}n}dA dB \\exp\\bigg( -\\frac{n}{2} \\text{tr} (A^2 + B^2 + 2cAB)\\bigg) f(A,B). \\end{equation*} Letting $A = U^\\dagger X U$, $B = V^\\dagger Y V$, where $X = \\text{diag}(x_1,\\cdots,x_n)$, $Y = \\text{diag}(y_1,\\cdots,y_n)$ are diagonal matrices, we can integrate out eigenvalue variables to obtain \\begin{align*} \u0026amp;= \\frac{1}{Z_n'}\\int{X,Y\\in \\mathbb{R}^n} dX dY V(X)^2V(Y)^2f(X,Y) \\exp\\bigg( -\\frac{n}{2} \\text{tr} (X^2 + Y^2)\\bigg) \\\\\\ \u0026amp;\\times\\int_{U \\in U(n)/U_{diag}(n)} dW \\exp\\big(nc \\text{tr} XWYW^\\dagger\\big). \\end{align*} The integral inside is precisely the Itzykson Zuber integral we computed previously; we insert the expression we derived for it into the above formula, absorbing all constant factors into the partition function: \\begin{align*} \\langle f(A,B) \\rangle_n \u0026amp;= \\frac{1}{Z_n''}\\int_{X,Y\\in \\mathbb{R}^n} dX dY V(X)^2V(Y)^2f(X,Y) \\exp\\bigg( -\\frac{n}{2} \\text{tr} (X^2 + Y^2)\\bigg) \\frac{\\det e^{nc x_iy_j }}{V(Y) V(X)}\\\\\\ \u0026amp;=\\frac{1}{Z_n''}\\int_{X,Y\\in \\mathbb{R}^n} \\prod_{k=1}^n dx_k dy_k f(x,y) V(x)V(y)\\exp\\bigg( -\\frac{n}{2} \\sum_{k=1} x_i^2 + y_i^2 + 2ncx_i y_i\\bigg). \\end{align*}\nThus, just as we were able to connect the 1-matrix model and orthogonal polynomials, we can connect the 2-matrix to bi-orthogonal polynomials; i.e., the polynomials $p_n(x),q_n(y)$ satisfying \\begin{align*} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} p_n(x)q_n(y) e^{-\\frac{n}{2}x^2-\\frac{n}{2}y^2-2nxy} dxdy = h_n \\delta_{nm} \\end{align*} Of course, the same sorts of arguments can be made for more general potentials besides $x^2,y^2$; we postpone discussion of this to a later entry.\n","date":1630189460,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630189460,"objectID":"4cf68919869f2fb9775d034399417e7a","permalink":"/posts/randommatrices/","publishdate":"2021-08-28T18:24:20-04:00","relpermalink":"/posts/randommatrices/","section":"posts","summary":"Here, we discuss some selected topics and techniqes from random matrix theory.

From Riemann’s point of view, the question was to address the discrepancy between the 3g-3-dimensional space of moduli for compact Riemann surfaces of genus g from the g(g+1)/2-dimensional space of Siegel matrices, in which the space of Riemann surfaces embeds, via the period matrix. The problem remained open for almost a millennium. The first hint of a solution to this problem was found (somewhat surprisingly) by I. Krichever (1977), when he showed (more or less) that the period matrix for a Riemann surface could be used to construct tau functions for the KP hierarchy. S. Novikov conjectured that the converse also held, thus answering the Riemann-Schottky problem a la methods of integrable systems. This turned out to indeed be the case, with a proof from T. Shiota (1986) shortly thereafter. In this talk, I will attempt to fill in some of the details of this story, and explain some of the consequences of this theorem, both in integrable systems and algebraic geometry.\n","date":1613415043,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1613415043,"objectID":"9aed11cfd5e8dbc541aef9717c8a1323","permalink":"/talk/riemann-schottky-problem/","publishdate":"2021-02-15T13:50:43-05:00","relpermalink":"/talk/riemann-schottky-problem/","section":"talk","summary":"Speaker: Nathan Hayford","tags":["integrable systems","algebraic geometry"],"title":"Methods of nonlinear equations in the theory of algebraic geometry","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Louis Arenas"],"categories":[],"content":"     Title: Weyl\u0026rsquo;s law and hearing the area of a drum\nSpeaker: Louis Arenas\nDate/Time: Wednesday, February 3rd, 3:00pm-4:00pm\nAbstract: H.

The first example would be to apply Laplace\u0026rsquo;s method to get one of the oldest asymptotic results, the Stirling\u0026rsquo;s formula, i.e. $$n!\\sim e^{-n}n^n\\sqrt{2\\pi n},n\\rightarrow \\infty.$$ Next example is to apply the saddle point method to get the asymptotic of the integral $$\\int_{\\mathbb{R}}f(z)e^{it(z^2+z)}dz,\\quad t\\rightarrow \\infty .$$ Then I will introduce one recently developed asymptotic method called $\\bar{\\partial}-$steepest descent method, and apply it to study the long-time asymptotic for the linear Schrödinger equation: $$ iu_t+u_{xx}=0,\\quad u(x,0)=q(x)\\in H^1(\\mathbb{R}). $$\nzoom: link\n","date":1598122025,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598122025,"objectID":"ec7542b36f989421adf726b9b1a35ffd","permalink":"/talk/asymptotic-methods-in-analysis/","publishdate":"2020-08-22T14:47:05-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/asymptotic-methods-in-analysis/","section":"talk","summary":"Speaker: Fudong Wang on August 27th, on Zoom","tags":["Riemann-Hilbert","asymptotics"],"title":"Asymptotic Methods in Analysis","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Louis Arenas"],"categories":[],"content":"   Title: Primes of the form $p = x^2 + ny^2$\nSpeaker: Louis Arenas\nDate: Thursday, August 6th\nTime: 2:00pm\nAbstract: In a letter to Mersenne, dated 1640, Fermat formulated a problem asking for sufficient conditions to the titular primes in the case when $n=1,2,3.$ The first well known proof to the original problem (in the case for when $n=1$) was published by Euler in 1749, with the other two cases being completed in 1772. Naturally, Euler attempted to generalize the problem for arbitrary integers n \u0026gt; 0; while not producing any proofs, the ideas that Euler touched on would be expanded by Legendre, Gauss, and Lagrange. The goal for this talk is to outline a strategy that answers Fermat\u0026rsquo;s original problem along with a few more cases. If time permits, we\u0026rsquo;ll just mention a result that solves the general problem for countably many n integers.\nLink to Zoom meeting: https://zoom.us/j/98801740991\nVideo: Google Drive\n","date":1596465854,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596465854,"objectID":"1d2a5f0c8b08d9ec559a736445852307","permalink":"/talk/primes-of-the-form/","publishdate":"2020-08-03T10:44:14-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/primes-of-the-form/","section":"talk","summary":"Speaker: Louis Arenas, scheduled at Thursday, August 6th 2:00pm on Zoom","tags":["number theory"],"title":"Primes of the Form $p = x^2 + ny^2$","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"   Title: Introduction to matroids\nSpeaker: Lina Fajardo Gomez\nDate: Thursday, July 30th\nTime: 2:00pm\nAbstract: Matroids are mathematical objects that abstract the notion of linearly independent sets.

In his 1903\u0026rsquo;s paper, Fredholm introduced a determinant of a functional, which now is called Fredholm determinant. In this lecture, we will begin with the definition of determinant in the finite-dimensional spaces and review some properties of the determinants. After that, we will focus on the determinant of form $det(I+F)$ where $F$ is \u0026ldquo;small\u0026rdquo;. Following Fredholm\u0026rsquo;s 1903 paper, we will discuss Fredholm determinant $D_f$ and explore some properties of the determinant and how it connects to the finite determinants. Lastly, we will discuss how to construct the famous \u0026ldquo;soliton\u0026rdquo; solution to the equation of Koreteweg-de Vries by the so-called Fredholm determinant method introduced by Pöppe(1983).\nVideo: google drive\n","date":1591635672,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591635672,"objectID":"260d2a99e4a1fb972b61f91c62412f4c","permalink":"/talk/fredholm-determinants/","publishdate":"2020-06-08T13:01:12-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/fredholm-determinants/","section":"talk","summary":"**Speaker**: Fudong Wang,\nscheduled at 2:00 pm, Thursday, June 11, 2020 on zoom ","tags":["Integrable Systems","Functional Analysis"],"title":"An Elementary Introduction to Fredholm Determinants","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Topology"],"content":"Speaker: Emanuele Zappala\nTime: 2:00pm, Thursday, June 4\nAbstract: In this talk I will give a brief introduction to knot theory and the notion of knot invariant.
