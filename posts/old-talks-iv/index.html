<meta property="og:description" content="Title: Modeling Physical Phenomenon: A derivation and exploration of
Laplacian growth.
Speaker: Nathan Hayford.
Date: Thursday, August $29^{th}$
Time: 3:30pm
Place: CMC 109
Abstract: Often the most interesting mathematical problems are
physically motivated: Laplacian growth is no exception. However, one may
wonder how such models are derived, i.e., what is their physical
relevance, what constitutes a good balance between an easily solvable
problem and a physically realistic one, among other questions. In this
talk, I plan on deriving Laplacian growth from first principles physics,
and explain the original motivations of the equation (in short, modeling
a 2D fluid domain&rsquo;s expansion/retraction as fluid is pumped in/out from
above). I will briefly discuss the integrable structure of Laplacian
growth, and how it leads to exact solutions of the equation; finally, if
time permits, I will mention another modern application of Laplacian
growth in condensed matter theory: the integer quantum Hall effect.\" />

            <p><strong>Title:</strong> Modeling Physical Phenomenon: A derivation and exploration of
Laplacian growth.<br>
<strong>Speaker:</strong> Nathan Hayford.<br>
<strong>Date:</strong> Thursday, August $29^{th}$<br>
<strong>Time:</strong> 3:30pm<br>
<strong>Place:</strong> CMC 109<br>
<strong>Abstract:</strong> Often the most interesting mathematical problems are

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Banach Algebra Approach to Wiener&rsquo;s Theorem.<br>
<strong>Speaker:</strong> Raymond Centner.<br>
<strong>Date:</strong> Thursday, August $15^{th}$<br>
<strong>Time:</strong> 2:00pm<br>
<strong>Place:</strong> CMC 108<br>
<strong>Abstract:</strong> The Banach algebra setting can be very natural and useful
in harmonic analysis. In 1932, Norbert Wiener proved that the space of
absolutely convergent Fourier series is inverse closed, i.e., if f is a
non-vanishing continuous function on the circle with an absolutely
convergent Fourier series, then 1/f has an absolutely convergent Fourier
series. Roughly ten years later, Israel Gelfand proved this result using
the theory of Banach algebras. The purpose of this talk is to present
this theorem in the context of Banach algebras, shedding light on the
usefulness of abstraction in classical analysis.\</p>
<p><strong>Title:</strong> What is ... the inverse scattering transform?<br>
<strong>Speaker:</strong> Fudong Wang.<br>
<strong>Date:</strong> Thursday, August $8^{th}$<br>
<strong>Time:</strong> 3:30pm<br>
<strong>Place:</strong> CMC 108<br>
<strong>Abstract:</strong> The story begins after the paper about a method for
solving the KdV equation by Gardner, Greene, Kruskal, and Miura (GGKM)
at 1967. That&rsquo;s a first example of using IST to solve a nonlinear
integrable equation. In 1968, Lax found an operator way to generalize
GGKM&rsquo;s method, which we now called &ldquo;Lax pair&rdquo;. In 1971, Zakharov and
Shabat use Lax&rsquo;s method to solve the NLS equation. In 1974, Ablowitz,
Kaup, Newell, and Segur (AKNS) compare GGKM, Lax and ZS&rsquo;s method in
nonlinear PDEs with the Fourier transform in the linear PDEs and the
term &ldquo;inverse scattering transform&rdquo; was born. In this talk, we will
briefly discuss how the inverse scattering transform works on solving
the NLS equation. If time allows, we will also talk about how to use IST
to generate the beautiful &ldquo;soliton&rdquo; wave solution.\</p>
<p><strong>Title:</strong> A Theorem of Radó Type for the <code>p</code>-Laplace equation in the
Heisenberg group<br>
<strong>Speaker:</strong> Zachary Forrest.<br>
<strong>Date:</strong> Wednesday, August $8^{th}$<br>
<strong>Time:</strong> 11:00am<br>
<strong>Place:</strong> CMC 108<br>
<strong>Abstract:</strong> It is known that in Euclidean spaces, the <code>p</code>-Laplace
equation possesses a Radó-type result: That is, given a domain
$\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ and a fixed exponent
$1&lt;\texttt{p}&lt;\infty$, a function $u \in C^1(\Omega)$ which is a
viscosity solution to the $\texttt{p}$- Laplace equation
$$-\Delta_\texttt{p}u=0 ,,,, (1)$$ in the set is also viscosity
solution solution to Equation (1) in $\Omega$. This result was proven in
a paper (2005) of Juutinen and Lindqvist via the use of the Implicit
Function Theorem, and motivated by this approach and the works of
Franchi-Serapioni-Serra Cassano (2007) &amp; Bieske (2006) we prove a
removability result for $\texttt{p}$-harmonic functions in the first
Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}_1$.</p>
<p><strong>Title:</strong> A Survey of the Polynomial Method.<br>
<strong>Speaker:</strong> Austin Dukes.<br>
<strong>Date:</strong> Thursday, August $1^{st}$<br>
<strong>Time:</strong> 3:30pm<br>
<strong>Place:</strong> CMC 13<br>
<strong>Abstract:</strong> Recently, we have seen a surge of progress on many
long-standing problems from various fields using methods based on ...
polynomials? Based on relatively simple combinatorial arguments and
dimension-counting from linear algebra, these polynomial methods were
not initially perceived to be especially insightful. However, applying
polynomials has shed light on subtle yet essential structure in many
problems spanning many areas, and these methods are currently an
exciting and active area of research. In this talk, we will discuss the
Polynomial Method as well as give various examples of its use in fields
such as incidence geometry, harmonic analysis, and computer science.\</p>
<p><strong>Title:</strong> Deep Learning.<br>
<strong>Speaker:</strong> Roshan Warman.<br>
<strong>Date:</strong> Thursday, July $25^{th}$<br>
<strong>Time:</strong> 3:30pm<br>
<strong>Place:</strong> CMC 13<br>
<strong>Abstract:</strong> Deep Learning has received an increasing amount of
attention in recent years due to its break-through applications in many
fields. In this presentation, we present an exposition to the
intellectual enterprises of Neural Networks, building them ground up
from simple decision-making models, and provide an overview on basic
machine learning algorithms, with the eventual goal to discuss more
mathematically involved theorems and areas of research in statistical
learning theory. The only pre-requisites are basic foundations of
Analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Title:</strong> Geometric group theory as a mathematical melting pot.<br>
<strong>Speaker:</strong> Lina Fajardo Gomez.<br>
<strong>Date:</strong> Thursday, July $18^{th}$<br>
<strong>Time:</strong> 3:30pm<br>
<strong>Place:</strong> CMC 13<br>
<strong>Abstract:</strong> Geometric group theory is an area that studies discrete
groups through the connections between algebraic properties of the
groups and the topological and geometric properties of the spaces they
act on. It is a relatively new area of study that remains very active
(as demonstrated by the many conferences in the field and programs that
focus on it). This seminar talk is intended as a broad introduction to
geometric group theory, with examples of how it relates to different
areas of mathematics, and a motivation for its study.\</p>
<p><strong>Title:</strong> Some fundamental formulas on the Cauchy-type integrals.<br>
<strong>Speaker:</strong> Fudong Wang.<br>
<strong>Date:</strong> Thursday, July $11^{th}$<br>
<strong>Time:</strong> 3:30pm<br>
<strong>Place:</strong> CMC 13<br>
<strong>Abstract:</strong> In the theory of boundary value problems of analytic
functions, Cauchy-type integrals play a fundamental role. There are
several fundamental formulas in the field, such like Sokhotsky-Plemelj
formula, Poincaré-Bertrand formula, Plemelj-Privalov theorem, and Marcel
Riesz&rsquo;s inequality on the Hilbert transform. In this seminar talk, we
will start from the beginning to prove some of the mentioned theorems.
Those theorems are frequently applied in the theory of Riemann-Hilbert
problem, Random matrices and integrable systems.\</p>
<p><strong>Title:</strong> Computing the Regulator of a Real Quadratic Order Using
p-Adic Methods.<br>
<strong>Speaker:</strong> Will Youmans.<br>
<strong>Date:</strong> Thursday, June $27^{th}$<br>
<strong>Time:</strong> 3:30pm<br>
<strong>Place:</strong> CMC 13<br>
<strong>Abstract:</strong> The regulator of a real quadratic order is defined as the
logarithm of the generator of the unit group (called the fundamental
unit). This value is closely tied to the class number and describes the
&quot;density&quot; of the units. The coefficients of the fundamental unit can
become very large, so rather than directly compute the regulator from
the fundamental unit itself we typically use a power product
representation of units derived from a generating set of relations for
the class group. Existing methods for computing the regulator from this
data suffer from a variable loss of precision which can be difficult to
control. We propose a p-adic method which simplifies the management of
the precision throughout the computation.\</p>
<p><strong>Title:</strong> What Can Random Matrices Do For You? <strong>Speaker:</strong> Nathan
Hayford.<br>
<strong>Date:</strong> Thursday, June $20^{th}$<br>
<strong>Time:</strong> 3:30pm<br>
<strong>Place:</strong> CMC 13<br>
<strong>Abstract:</strong> Random matrix theory has been an indispensable tool for
mathematical physicists for the past few decades, but one may wonder how
relevant it is outside of this field. In this talk, I plan on explaining
the basics of random matrices, and how they have been used in fields
such as knot theory, graph combinatorics, number theory, biology,
quantum gravity, integrable systems, orthogonal polynomials, and... you
get the point. If time permits (and depending on the audience), I&rsquo;ve
also prepared some more detailed examples of how random matrix theory is
used in each of these contexts. I&rsquo;ll try and share as many of these as I
can in the allotted time.\</p>
<p><strong>Title:</strong> The presentation of the Braid group and faithfulness of its
Burau representation.<br>
<strong>Speaker:</strong> Louis Arenas.<br>
<strong>Date:</strong> Thursday, June $13^{th}$<br>
<strong>Time:</strong> 3:30pm<br>
<strong>Place:</strong> CMC 13<br>
<strong>Abstract:</strong> The talk will be centered on familiarizing the audience
with the geometric braid group and it&rsquo;s presentation. From here, we will
see for a particular representation, for what parameters it will be
faithful.</p>
